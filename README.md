Grandma’s Car is an AI-assisted used-car marketplace designed for families, students, and budget-conscious buyers who want a reliable vehicle without the stress of traditional car shopping. The platform highlights well-maintained, high-reliability cars (even with higher mileage), requires mechanic inspections for listings, and provides transparent maintenance insights.

The prototype includes a fully functional AI search tool, a conversational assistant (“Grandma’s Assistant”), featured listings, a seller flow, a mechanic directory, and car detail pages with reliability and maintenance information.

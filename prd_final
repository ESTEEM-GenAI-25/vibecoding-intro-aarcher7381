1. Product Overview (Updated)

Buying a used car is stressful, opaque, and often unfair to buyers—especially families, students, and people with limited budgets who simply need a reliable vehicle. Traditional marketplaces prioritize flashy listings and mileage over actual care, honesty, and long-term reliability. Users also struggle to understand what to look for before purchasing, leading to fear, confusion, and sometimes costly mistakes.

Grandma’s Car is a transparency-first used-car marketplace designed for “real people on real budgets.” The platform highlights well-maintained older vehicles, requires mechanic inspections and service history documentation, and pairs these with two AI-powered features: a natural-language car search and a conversational assistant. The current prototype demonstrates a complete marketplace flow including featured cars, detailed listings, maintenance forecasting, seller onboarding, a mechanic directory, and fully functional AI interactions integrated using Google AI Studio.

3. AI Specification (Final)
What the AI Does

Grandma’s Car uses generative AI for two tasks:

Natural-Language Car Search

Inputs: A user’s open-ended query (e.g., “safe AWD SUV under $15k for snow”).

Process: Interprets budget, seating needs, terrain, reliability, efficiency, and buyer priorities.

Outputs: Tailored car suggestions with reasoning (e.g., reliability score, fit-for-use, cost).

Grandma’s Assistant (Conversational Chatbot)

Provides warm, supportive recommendations.

Reflects model knowledge about make/model/year reliability.

Explains maintenance considerations and trade-offs in conversational language.

Location in User Flow

Appears on homepage and dedicated “Assistant” section.

Search bar integrated into main navigation and featured cars page.

Helps users early in decision-making (“I don’t know what I need”) rather than final purchase steps.

Model / Tool

Built using Google AI Studio

Likely powered by Gemini 1.5 Flash (text model) within vibe coding environment

Constraints & Guardrails

Assistant avoids definitive mechanical claims

Encourages professional inspections (“check with a mechanic”)

No pricing guarantees

Refrains from legal/financial advice

Does not store query data

Limited examples reduce hallucination risk

4. Technical Architecture (Reality Check)
Front-End

Auto-generated HTML/CSS from Google AI Studio

Manual adjustments for images, icons, and UI structure

Inline JavaScript for chat logic and search interactions

Hardcoded inventory dataset (JSON-like structure inside the HTML)

AI Integration

Direct calls to Gemini inside AI Studio-generated JavaScript

One model reused for both AI features with different prompting contexts

No backend server; all logic handled client-side via AI Studio environment

External Services

Pexels for vehicle images (free/commercial-use photos)

No external automotive APIs integrated

5. Prompting & Iteration Summary

I used vibe-coding tools iteratively, starting with a broad marketplace generation prompt (“build a used car site like Autotrader with AI features”). From there:

Key Prompts

“Please make the AI Buyer Assistant Chat functional.”

Critical for enabling real conversational responses.

“Use a playful color palette with orange, green, blue, pink, and purple.”

Directed brand design.

“Match these Pexels images to the correct make/model.”

Corrected AI’s mismatched sample data.

“Create icons for reliability score and mechanic inspection.”

Added user-facing trust signals.

How Prompts Evolved

Early prompts were broad (site layout); later prompts became very specific (tone, layout, functionality).

Adjusting tone and persona required multiple iterations to achieve the warm, “grandma-like” voice.

Making the chatbot functional involved prompting the system to bind UI elements to the model.

What I Learned

Specificity dramatically improves output quality.

AI-generated UIs require human editing.

Persona-based prompting changes user experience significantly.

Vibe coding accelerates prototypes but still relies on human oversight.

6. UX & Limitations
Intended User Journey

Land on homepage → understand value proposition

Browse featured cars

Use AI search or Grandma’s Assistant to narrow options

View car details + maintenance forecast

If selling, follow inspection → upload → listing flow

Explore verified mechanics as needed

Known Limitations

Static inventory; no live data or backend

Reliability scores are demo-generated, not from real datasets

Maintenance forecasts are illustrative

No real authentication, payment, or messaging systems

Chatbot may occasionally generalize or hallucinate minor details

When Users Shouldn’t Rely on the Tool

For mechanical assessments

For pricing valuations

For legal/financial car-buying decisions

As a substitute for a certified mechanic’s inspection

7. Future Roadmap

VIN-based reliability and recall integration using NHTSA or external APIs

Real seller accounts & dynamic listings with a full backend

Mechanic partner portal for uploading inspection reports directly

Advanced AI scoring using historical maintenance + reliability datasets

Mobile-first redesign for broader accessibility
